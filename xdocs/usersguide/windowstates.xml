			Window States indicate the amount of the portal page 
			space that will be assigned to the generated 
			content of a portlet. 
				<ul>
					<li>Normal - indicates the portlet may be sharing the rendering of the page.</li>
					<li>Minimized - the portlet should only render minimal or no output at all.</li>
					<li>Maximized - indicates the portlet that the portlet may be the only portlet being rendered. A portlet may generate richer content in this state.</li>

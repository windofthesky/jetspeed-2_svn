				There are multiple ways to end your session with Jetspeed.  The easiest and most secure is to click the logout link located in the upper
				right of the portal window.  Logging out returns the user to the Jetspeed Welcome Page where you can login again.

			<subsection name="Session Timeout">
			<p>
				Session timeout occurs after a designated amount of time has passed and no interaction between Jetspeed the browser has occurred.  This setting is configurable by your administrator.  
				Interacting with Jetspeed at any time after the timeout has occurred will result in the user being presented with the Jetspeed Welcome Page.
			</p>

			<subsection name="Clearing Cookies">

				Clearing the browsers cookies will also result in the user being logged out.  In certain situations such as SSO (Single Sign On), clearing the cookies
				can be the safest way to logout.

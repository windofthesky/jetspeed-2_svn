Layout templates are packaged in special Jetspeed-specific and deployable portlet applications. 
Layout templates control the overall aggregation of a portal page. Layout templates are 
combined with portlets, providing a component model for aggregation. Jetspeed-2 comes out 
of the box with several layout components including one, two and three column layouts. 
See the <a href='#Jetspeed-2 Layouts'>Jetspeed-2 Layouts</a> below for all available Layouts in the 
default Jetspeed-2 system. Of course you can define and derive your own layouts.

A l ayout defines the fashion in which grouping of fragments
will organized relative to the final, aggregated
content of a request to the portal. Layouts are defined by 
a portlet which applies an algorithm to a template to 
generate the aggregated content of a page. Typical
algorithms are two column, three column, nested.

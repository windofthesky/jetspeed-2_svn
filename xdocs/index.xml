				Jetspeed-2 is the next-generation enterprise portal at
				Apache. Jetspeed-2 offers several architectural
				enhancements and improvements over Jetspeed 1.0. First,
				Jetspeed-2 is conformant to the
				<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">Java Portlet Standard</a> 
				and provides a standard mechanism for the deployment
				of portlets. Second, Jetspeed-2 has matured to a more
				scalable architecture featuring multi-threaded
				functionality. Third, Jetspeed-2 is decoupled from
				several legacy open source projects. Fourth, Jetspeed-2
				is based on a component architecture.

			<subsection name="About Jetspeed-2">
				<p>
Jetspeed is an Open Portal Platform and Enterprise Information Portal, written entirely in open source under the Apache license in Java and XML.
Jetspeed is an open component portal architecture based on standards. All access to the portal is managed through a robust portal security policy.
Within a Jetspeed portal, individual portlets can be aggregated to create a page. Each portlet is an independent application with 
Jetspeed acting as the central hub making information from multiple sources available in an easy to use manner.
				</p>
				<p>
A portal based on Jetspeed can make applications, database information and other data sources available to end-users through a single web site. 
Jetspeed provides a security infrastructure so that the information and functions made available to each user can be customized on basis of the
 user or a role that the user has. The user can access the portal via a web browser, WAP-phone, pager or any other device supported by the servlet engine.

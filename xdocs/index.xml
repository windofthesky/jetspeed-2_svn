Jetspeed is an Open Portal Platform and Enterprise Information Portal, written entirely in open source under the Apache license in Java and XML and based on open standards.
All access to the portal is managed through a robust portal security policy. Within a Jetspeed portal, individual portlets can be aggregated to create a page. Each portlet is an independent application with 
Jetspeed acting as the central hub making information from multiple sources available in an easy to use manner.
				</p>
<p>
Version 2.1.3 is conformant to the
				<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">Java Portlet 1.0 Standard</a>. Version 2.2 will be conformant to the  
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286">Java Portlet 2.0 Standard</a>.</p>				
				<p>
A portal based on Jetspeed can make applications, database information and other data sources available to end-users through a single web site. 
Jetspeed provides a security infrastructure so that the information and functions made available to each user can be customized on basis of the
 user or a role that the user has. The user can access the portal via a web browser, WAP-phone, pager or any other device supported by the servlet engine.
				</p>
	<p>
		
The Jetspeed enterprise portal integrates dynamic information, people, and processes across organization boundaries. This content is aggregated using portlets from diverse sources. 
Portlets are just mini-web applications, or web-components. Jetspeed always provides secured access to the portlets. A short overview of Jetspeed <a href="feature.html">features</a>:
<ul>
<li>Secure Access - Security based on standards, ACLs</li>

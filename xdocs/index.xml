				Jetspeed-2 is the next-generation enterprise portal at
				Apache. Jetspeed-2 offers several architectural
				enhancements and improvements over Jetspeed 1.0. First,
				Jetspeed-2 is conformant to the
				<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">Java Portlet Standard</a> 
				and will provide a standard mechanism for the deployment
				of portlets. Second, Jetspeed-2 has matured to a more
				scalable architecture featuring multi-threaded
				functionality. Third, Jetspeed-2 is decoupled from
				several legacy open source projects. Fourth, Jetspeed-2
				is based on a component architecture.

				<p>
					The first production release of Jetspeed-2 was released
					on December 8, 2005.  Future development areas include 
					improved caching and clustering support, further AJAX integration,
				    new portlet applications, WSRP support, better design
					and use experience.

			<subsection name="About Jetspeed-2">
				<p>
					Jetspeed is an Open Source implementation of an
					Enterprise Information Portal, written in Java and
					XML. Within a Jetspeed portal, individual portlets
					can be aggregated to create a page. Each portlet is
					an independent application with Jetspeed acting as
					the central hub making information from multiple
					sources available in an easy to use manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					A portal based on Jetspeed can make applications,
					database information and other data sources
					available to end-users through a single web site.
					Jetspeed provides a security infrastructure so that
					the information and functions made available to each
					user can be customized on basis of the user or a
					role that the user has. The user can access the
					portal via a web browser, WAP-phone, pager or any
					other device supported by the servlet engine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Content held in a wide variety of formats such as
					XML, RSS or database tables can be integrated within
					a Jetspeed page. The actual presentation of the data
					is handled via XSL and delivered to the user via
					combinations of data presentation tools such as Java
					Server Pages (JSPs), Velocity and HTML. Jetspeed
					provides support for templating and content
					publication frameworks such as
					<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a>
					,
					<a href="http://www.webmacro.org">WebMacro</a>
					and
					<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">
						Velocity

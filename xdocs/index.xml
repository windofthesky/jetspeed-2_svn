    Jetspeed-2 is the next-generation enterprise portal at Apache.
    Jetspeed-2 offers several architectural enhancements and improvements over Jetspeed 1.0. 
    First, Jetspeed-2 is conformant to the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">Java Portlet Standard</a> and will provide a standard mechanism for the deployment of portlets.  
    Second, Jetspeed-2 has matured to a more scalable architecture featuring multi-threaded functionality.  
    Third, Jetspeed-2 is decoupled from several legacy open source projects.  
    Fourth, Jetspeed-2 is based on a component architecture.

<section name="What is Jetspeed?">
      <p>        
Jetspeed is an Open Source implementation of an Enterprise Information Portal, using Java and XML.
A portal makes network resources (applications, databases and so forth) available to end-users. The 
user can access the portal via a web browser, WAP-phone, pager or any other device. Jetspeed acts 
as the central hub where information from multiple sources are made available in an easy to use manner. 
</p>
      <p>

The data presented via Jetspeed is independent of content type, This means that content from for example
XML,RSS or SMTP can be integrated with Jetspeed. The actual presentation of the data is 
handled via ates XSL and delivered to the user for example via the combination of Java Server Pages (JSPs) 
and HTML. Jetspeed provides support for templating and content publication frameworks such as 
<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a>, <a href="http://www.webmacro.org/">WebMacro</a> and 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">Velocity</a>. Note that outside of regular browser Jetspeed also supports WAP devices.
</p>
      <p>
Jetspeed helps you build portal applications quickly. The goal is to make Jetspeed a tool for both portal developers as well 
as user interface designers. Currently the focus is on providing developers with a set of tools that facilitates building
the base for the portal. With Jetspeed you can quickly build an XML
portal and also syndicate your own content.

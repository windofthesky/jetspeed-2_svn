				Jetspeed-2 provides an integration with the popular Apache
				Lucene search engine, a high-performance, full-featured
				text search engine library written entirely in Java; a
				technology suitable for nearly any application that requires
				full-text search, especially cross-platform.
			</p>
			<p>
				By default, Jetspeed-2 indexes all registry information: portlet
				instances and portlet definitions as searchable entities.
			</p>
			<p>Configuration for the Search Engine is in the Spring configuration file <code>search.xml</code>
			You can configure the location of your search indices in this Spring configuration file.
			Note you may want to move the location of your indices outside the Jetspeed web application
			</p>

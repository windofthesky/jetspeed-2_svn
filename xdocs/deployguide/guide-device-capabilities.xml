            <p>
				Jetspeed capabilities provides a mechanism for mapping the client
				(browser) used to access the portal to media types for page rendering.
			</p>
			<p>
				A device is associated with a list of capabilities, allowing the portal
				to know what kind of content the device can handle (such as
				Javascript, DHTML..)
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules for mapping devices to media types and capabilities are
				stored in the database. The original values for these are first populated with
				XML data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your custom build should be setup with the default XML data for
				devices and media types. Currently there is no administrative portlets for editing device information.
			</p>
			<p>
				A full set of capabilities, devices, media types and mime types are
				supplied with the XML test data.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Jetspeed-2 capability engine maps clients to media types to
				mime types. Here are some more detailed definitions:
				<ul>
					<li>Clients: The application that initiates a request to the Jetspeed-2
					portal engine. Jetspeed-2 uses the User-Agent to determine the
					client that initiates a request.</li>
					<li>Media Type: The type of media requesting the content (HTML,
					WML, etc.). Content in Jetspeed-2 can be requested by different
					type of devices through different media.</li>
					<li>Mime Type: The type of content being requested.</li>
					<li>Supported Media Types: HTML, XHTML-BASIC, XML, WML, VXML</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

Define the default mime types
<source><![CDATA[
<MimeTypes>
	<MimeType>application/xhtml+xml</MimeType>
	<MimeType>text/html</MimeType>
	<MimeType>text/vnd.wap.wml</MimeType>
	<MimeType>text/vxml</MimeType>
	<MimeType>text/xhtml</MimeType>
	<MimeType>text/xml</MimeType>
</MimeTypes>
]]></source>
			</p>

			<p>
Define media types (used in special _control folder processing) and preferred mime type:
<source><![CDATA[
<MediaType name="html">
	<charcterSet value="UTF-8"/>
	<title value="HTML"/>
	<description value="Rich HTML for HTML 4.0 compliants browsers"/>
	<capabilities></capabilities>
	<mimeTypes>text/html</mimeTypes>
</MediaType>
]]></source>
			</p>


			<p>
Defines supported Clients (browsers) by the portal and their device
capabilities. Clients are mapped to media types via the preferred
mime type
<source><![CDATA[
<Client name="ie5mac" evalOrder="1" preferredMimeTypeID="text/html">
	<userAgentPattern value=".*MSIE 5.*Mac.*"/>
	<version value="5.*"/>
	<model value="None"/>
	<manufacturer value="Microsoft"/>
	<capabilities>
		HTML_3_2,HTML_JAVA,HTML_JAVASCRIPT, HTML_TABLE,HTML_FORM,HTML_FRAME,HTML_IMAGE,HTML_PLUGIN,HTML_CSS1,HTML_DOM_NS4, HTTP_COOKIE
	</capabilities>
	<mimeTypes>text/html</mimeTypes>
</Client>

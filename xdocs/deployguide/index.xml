		<section name="Deployment Guide">
			<p>
				This guide is targeted for helping administrators and developers configure and deploy Jetspeed to application servers. While the Administrative Guide documents configuring
				Jetspeed within the portal user interface, this guide documents configuring and deploying with Spring configurations and Java properties files.  
				<br/><br/>
			</p>
		<subsection name="Configuring Jetspeed 2.2 Components">
            <p>Jetspeed provides very flexible ways for specific configuration settings.</p>
            <p>Jetspeed components are initially loaded from <strong><code>/WEB-INF/assembly/</code></strong> folder, while the default configuration properties are loaded from <strong><code>/WEB-INF/conf/jetspeed.properties.</code></strong></p>
            <p>The initial/default configurations can be overrided through the <strong><code>/WEB-INF/assembly/override/</code></strong> folder, while overrides/additional values can be provided through the <strong><code>/WEB-INF/conf/override.properties.</code></strong></p>
            <p>Another new feature is conditional Spring assembly loading. Jetspeed provides an extended BeanFactory
            which checks a loaded Spring BeanDefinition for some extra meta data (defined within the Spring configuration itself)
            against a predefined configuration, registering a BeanDefinition within Spring can be "prevented", effectively
            filtering out certain definitions.</p>

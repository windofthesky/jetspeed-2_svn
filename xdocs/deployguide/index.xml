            <p>
                This guide is targeted at helping administrators and developers configure and deploy Jetspeed to application servers. While the Administrative Guide documents configuring
                Jetspeed within the portal user interface, this guide documents configuring and deploying with Spring configurations and Java properties files.  
            </p>
            
            <subsection name="Deploying Jetspeed 2">
                <p>
                    Jetspeed can be deployed in a variety of application servers. This guide describes the deployments procedure
                    for <a href="guide-tomcat.html">Apache Tomcat</a> and <a href="deploying-jetspeed-to-websphere.html">IBM Websphere</a>.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="Configuring Jetspeed 2 Components">
                <p>Jetspeed provides very flexible ways for specific configuration settings.</p>
                <p>Jetspeed components are initially loaded from <strong><code>/WEB-INF/assembly/</code></strong> folder, while the default configuration properties are loaded from <strong><code>/WEB-INF/conf/jetspeed.properties.</code></strong></p>
                <p>The initial/default configurations can be overridden through the <strong><code>/WEB-INF/assembly/override/</code></strong> folder, while overrides/additional values can be provided through the <strong><code>/WEB-INF/conf/override.properties.</code></strong></p>
                <p>Another new feature is conditional Spring assembly loading. Jetspeed provides an extended BeanFactory
                which checks a loaded Spring BeanDefinition for some extra meta data (defined within the Spring configuration itself)
                against a predefined configuration, registering a BeanDefinition within Spring can be "prevented", effectively
                filtering out certain definitions.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="This guide">
                <p>
                    The deployment guide describes the <a href="jetspeed-properties.html">properties that can be configured</a>, 
                    and how to <a href="override-properties.html">override the default values</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a short introduction to managing <a href="config-spring.html">Spring configurations</a>, and how to 
                    <a href="config-overrides.html">override</a> the default Spring configurations with your own deployment customization. 
                    The entire Jetspeed portal is constructed with a Spring configuration. This deployment guide documents the key components
                     that you can override. The guide is categorized, in the menu on the left-hand-side, into describing the general subjects of <b>Security Components</b> and <b>Portal Components</b>.

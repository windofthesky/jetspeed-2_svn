				<p>
					Jetspeed 2 can use the Tomcat Manager application
					for managing portlet applications with the Portlet
					Application Lifecycle Manager Portlet (PALM). To be
					able to do so it needs a configured Tomcat user with
					the predefined 'manager' role in the
					${org.apache.jetspeed.server.home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
				</p>
				<p>
					A minimal example tomcat-users.xml can look like:
					<source>
						<![CDATA[
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
    <user username="j2deployer" password="xxxxx" roles="manager"/>
</tomcat-users>]]>
					</source>
					<i>
						The attribute values for username and password
						must correspond to the specified values for
						<code>
							${org.apache.jetspeed.services.autodeployment.user}
						</code>
						and
						<code>
							${org.apache.jetspeed.services.autodeployment.user}
						</code>
						as described above.

				<p>
					To have redeployment and undeployment working
					properly when using Tomcat 5.5.9 on Windows you have
					to set the global Context attribute "antiJARLocking"
					to true.
				</p>
				<p>
					In
					${org.apache.jetspeed.server.home}\conf\context.xml
					use:
					<source>
						<![CDATA[
    <Context antiJARLocking="true">
    ...
    </Context>]]>

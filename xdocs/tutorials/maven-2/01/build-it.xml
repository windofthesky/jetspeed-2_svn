    <section name="Building and Deploying a Custom Jetspeed Portal">
      <p>      
       Now that you have generated a custom portal named <b>jetexpress</b>, we are ready to build the portal.
       We are going to build the portal from the command line:
      </p>
	 <source>
	 <![CDATA[
# Linux	 
cd /JetspeedTraining/workspace/jetexpress  	 

# Windows
cd \JetspeedTraining\workspace\jetexpress  	 

mvn -P tomcat,min
     ]]>
	</source> 
      <p>
      <i>Please take note that there is no space between the comma and the word <b>min</b></i>
      </p>
      <p>
      We are building a <b>min</b> (minimal) deployment. The Min deployment only creates a Jetspeed core portal and a Jetspeed Admin portlet application (j2-admin).
      When the build process completes, you should see the message <b>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</b> at the end of a large amount of build logging information      
      The portal is built into a temp directory named <i>target</i> found directory under your <i>jetexpress</i> project directory.
      As well as building, the <i>tomcat,min</i> goals also:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>deploys Jetspeed to the Tomcat application server. If you are following the training material,
      the Tomcat directory is located under <i>/JetspeedTraining/tomcat-express/</i></li>
      <li>creates the Jetspeed core schema tables in the Derby database</li>
      <li>populates the database with a minimal set of portal information, including default roles, groups, profiles, and administrative users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Now that we've built and deployed the portal, lets start up the application server...

      <p>      
       Now that you have generated a portlet app named <b>express-demo</b>, we are ready to build the portal.
       We are going to build the portal from the command line:
      </p>
	 <source>
	 <![CDATA[
# Linux	 
cd /JetspeedTraining/workspace/jetexpress/applications/express-demo

# Windows
cd \JetspeedTraining\workspace\jetexpress\applications\express-demo

mvn 
     ]]>
	</source> 
      <p>
      This builds a portlet application war file name <i>express-demo-1.0.war</i>.
      This war file is found under <i>target</i> directory. It is a standard JSR-168 portlet application distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now that we've built and deployed the portal, lets start up the application server (if its not already started).
      While the app server is running, we can drop in the portlet application.
      </p>	
	 <source>
	 <![CDATA[
# Linux	 
cd /JetspeedTraining/workspace/jetexpress/applications/express-demo
cp target/express-demo-1.0.war /JetspeedTraining/tomcat-express/webapps/express-demo.war

# Windows
cd \JetspeedTraining\workspace\jetexpress\applications\express-demo
copy target\express-demo-1.0.war \JetspeedTraining\tomcat-express\webapps\express-demo.war

     ]]>
	</source> 
	<p>This will deploy your portlet application. Next, lets see how to add your new portlets to a page.

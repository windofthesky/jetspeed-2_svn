			<p>
				The Jetspeed Ant Tutorial is provided as zip files and
				downloaded from the Apache Portals website. There are two
				projects available for download: the source code for a Custom Jetspeed
				Portal named "jetexpress" in the <b>jetexpress.zip</b> distribution, and an example portlet application named
				"express-demo" found in the	<b>express-demo.zip</b>	directory.
			</p>			
			<p>
				Note that we make a clean separation between the portal
				(Jetspeed) integration code, and the portlet
				application. Additionally, you will be required to download an official release of Jetspeed 2.1.2 in basic installer format.
				The Jetspeed installer is the foundation of a custom installer that we will create in this tutorial.

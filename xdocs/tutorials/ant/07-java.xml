		<section name="Java Overview">
			<p>
You do not have to be a Java programmer to install and configure a Jetspeed portal but you will need to have a <a href="www.java.sum.com">Java SDK(Software Development Kit)</a> installed.
This is not the same as the Java Run-time Library.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Installing Java">
			<subsection name='Installation'>
				<p>
			Download <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">Java version 5</a>(not version 6).
	Follow the instructions and choose the default installation configuration.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name='Environment Variables'>
				<p> 
				You will need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the root of the Java installation.
				</p>
				<p>In addition, you will need to add JAVA_HOME/bin or JAVA_HOME\bin (for Windows) to your PATH</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name='Testing Java'>
				<p>
Open a comand window and type "java -version". If the information typed out matches the version of Java that you installed, then you probably have a working Java SDK.
If not check your installation and Environment variables.</p>

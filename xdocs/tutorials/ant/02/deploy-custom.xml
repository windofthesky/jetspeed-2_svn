			<p>
				To deploy the new resources (decorations, themes, and
				page) that we created in this section of the tutorial,
				you could simply rebuild the portal by typing
				<b>mvn -P tomcat,min</b>
				. Or, if your portal is aleady up and running, a simpler
				way is to automate the easy deployment tasks with Ant.
				We have created a simple build.xml to copy over changed
				portal resources:
			</p>
			<source>
				<![CDATA[
# Linux	 
cd /JetspeedTraining/workspace/jetexpress
cp ../../resources/build.xml .

# Windows
cd \JetspeedTraining\workspace\jetexpress
copy  ..\..\resources\build.xml
     ]]>
			</source>
			<p>
				To copy over the resources to the running portal, type:
			</p>
			<source>
				<![CDATA[
ant	 
     ]]>
			</source>
			<p>
				Refresh the portal home page,
				<a href="http://localhost:8080/jetexpress/portal">
					http://localhost:8080/jetexpress/portal
				</a>
				You should now see a portal with our new custom
				decorators:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="../images/jetexpress-portal.png" />
			</p>
			<p>and desktop theme:</p>

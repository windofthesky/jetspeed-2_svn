		<section name="Running the Installer">
		<p>After running the <b>create-installer</b> target successfully, we can now install your custom portal.
		The installer will:
		</p> 			
			<ul>
				<li>
					deploys Jetspeed and the Tomcat application server.
					If you are following the training material, the
					Tomcat directory is located under
					<i>/JetspeedTraining/tomcat-express/</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					creates the Jetspeed core schema tables in the Derby
					database
				</li>
				<li>
					populates the database with a minimal set of portal
					information, including default roles, groups,
					profiles, and administrative users
				</li>
			</ul>
		<p>To run the installer:</p>
<source>
<![CDATA[		
cd dist
java -jar jetexpress-installer.jar
   ]]>
</source>							
			<p>Follow through the installation instructions. Feel free to use any database backend. However, if you are not using Derby,
			it is up to you to provide the latest database driver</p>
			<p>
				Now that we've built and deployed the portal, lets start
				up the application server...

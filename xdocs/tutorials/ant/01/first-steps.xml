		<section name="Installing Java, Eclipse and Ant">
			<p>
				If you have not already done so, install
				<a href="../references/java.html">Java</a>
				,
				<a href="../references/ant.html">Ant</a>
				and
				<a href="../references/eclipse.html">
					Eclipse.
					<a />
				</a>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name='Download the JetExpress portal source'>
			<div class="todo"><p>
				You can download the JetExpress source code from
				<a href="http://people.apache.org/~taylor/tutorial/">Tutorial Download Location</a>. Additionally, you will need to download a Jetspeed final release installer.
			</p></div>
			<p>The distribution kit is described in more detail in the <a href="../references/tutorial_distribution.html">Tutorial Distribution Kit</a> document.</p>
			<p>
				Once you have downloaded the distribution kit, expand the two projects: jetexpress, express-demo, directly into your Eclipse workspace.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Project Directory Structure">
				<p>
				The structure of the JetExpress project is described in
					<a href='../references/project_directory.html'>
						Project Directory Overview.
					</a>
					Take some time to familiarize yourself with the structure.
				</p>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name='Creating the JetExpress Project in Eclipse'>
			<p>
				Once the project is installed on your disk, it can be
				setup as an Eclipse Project by simply importing the project in place.
			</p>

			<p>
				The project is now ready to build but still needs some
				property changes before it can be deployed for testing on the
				servlet engine.
			</p>

		</section>
		<section name="Ant Targets for JetExpress">
			<p>
				When Ant is used to build a project in Eclipse, the
				project must have a file called "build.xml" in the root
				directory. This file contains the list of tasks that Ant
				can execute. These are called "targets".
			</p>
			<p>
				Before getting started with the tutorial, review the Ant
				targets that are available in the
				<a href='../references/ant_targets.html'>
					JetExpress tutorial's build.xml file.:
				</a>
			</p>			
		</section>
		<section name='Ant Properties'>
			<p>There are a few critical properties that must be configured.
			See the reference 
				<a href='../references/ant_targets.html#Build Properties'>build.properties</a> which are also discussed below.
			</p>		
		<subsection
			name='Change the Jetspeed-2 Server (Tomcat) Location Property'>
			<p>
				JetExpress comes with a built-in servlet engine. When you run the installer, you can choose which
				directory to install the servlet engine into. The installer will allow you to select a location to install
				the JetExpress portal into. After running the installer, please remember the directory where you installed into.
			    There are a few development-mode targets in Ant that need to know where Tomcat is installed. Set the property in your build.properties, for example:
			</p>
			<source>
				<![CDATA[		
app.server.home = /JetspeedTraining/servers/tomcat-express
     ]]>
			</source>
		</subsection>
		<subsection
			name='Change the Jetspeed-2 Server (Tomcat) Location Property'>
			<p>One of the resources downloaded is the Jetspeed 2.1.2 installer.
			Please place the installer someplace on your file system, and then update the property:
			</p>
			<source>
<![CDATA[		
installer.src.jar = /JetspeedTraining/installers/jetspeed-2.1.1-dev-installer.jar
   ]]>
			</source>

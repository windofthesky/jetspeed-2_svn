			name="Welcome to the Jetspeed-2 Tutorial with Ant and Eclipse">
			
				<p>
					This Jetspeed-2 tutorial is a step-by-step set of
					instructions and source code for creating a custom
					Jetspeed-2 Portal from scratch using Ant and
					Eclipse.
				</p>
			
			<p>
				When starting a new Jetspeed-2 portal project, we
				strongly recommend that you create a new portal project
				using the working JetExpress as a base. Do not edit the
				Jetspeed-2 source and resources directly.
			</p>
			<p>
				As your project progresses, you may want to look at the
				Jetspeed-2 sources to answer questions or for hints on
				how to implement additional functionality in the Portal
				framework. It is not a bad idea to download them into a
				separate Eclipse project for ease of access.
			</p>
			<subsection name='Goal of the Tutorial'>
				<p>
					This tutorial will guide you through the steps to
					create your own sample portal based on a working
					portal called
					<b>JetExpress</b>
					. The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to
					create your own custom Jetspeed-2 portal, complete
					with your own set of portal pages, your company
					logos and text, your own set of portlet
					applications, and any special integration required
					to run your portlets inside Jetspeed-2.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are going to use the following steps to get you
					started:
					<ul>
						<li>
							We will get the development environment
							setup.
						</li>
						<li>
							Then, we will build and test the JetExpress
							as it is comes "out of the box". It is a
							simple portal with a very basic layout and
							simple "look and feel". It will support
							logging in and a few simple portlets.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once it runs, we will show you how to alter
							the "look and feel" with your own logo and
							colour scheme.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once you can change the appearance, we will
							show how to add portlets to a Jetspeed-2
							Portal. Since Jetspeed-2 complies with the
							JSR-168 portlet specification, any JSR-168
							portlet can be configured as part of your
							application.
						</li>
						<li>
							We will then start 4 new
							<strong>portlet</strong>
							projects and show you how to build your own
							JSR-168 portlets and add them to your
							customized portal.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once we have implemented some custom
							portlets we will show how Jetspeed-2 can
							used to provide WebServices.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally, we will discuss some of the
							alternatives for Servlet containers and
							databases. We will also introduce you to the
							full Jetspeed-2 documentation, the pre-built
							portals and the support services available.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name='Prerequisites'>
				<p>
					The tutorial requires the following software
					installed on your system:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="refences/java.html">Java</a>
						1.4 or higher. Java 5 is recommended.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="refences/eclipse.html">Eclipse</a>
						3.2.2 or higher
					</li>
					<li>WTP Eclipse plug-in</li>
					<li>
						<a href="refences/ant.html">Ant</a>
						1.7.1 or higher
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="06/databases.html">Database</a>
						- The tutorial uses
						<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby">Derby</a>
						which is included the tutorial.
					</li>
					<li>
						The tutorial includes its own built-in
						<a href="06/servlet.html">servlet engine</a>
					</li>

				</ul>
				<p>
					Of course, you will need an internet connection to
					use internet-based portlets and download components.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<p>
				If you are familiar with Eclipse, Ant and Java you can
				<a href='01/first-steps.html'>
					start work on the tutorial.
				</a>
				Otherwise, take some time to review the pre-requisite
				software packages that are new to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				You might also want to take a quick look at the
				<a href="knowledge.html">skills profile</a>
				that this tutorial assumes.

			<p>
				Now that you have generated a portlet app named
				<b>express-demo</b>
				, we are ready to integrate the new portlets into our
				system. This is done by adding the portlets to the
				portal pages. These pages are also known as PSML files.
				Your pages makeup the navigational site of your system.
				The new pages we are going to add will have references
				to the new portlets added in the express-demo portlet
				applications. Of course users can use the Portlet
				Selector and Jetspeed Customizer to select portlets
				interactively. Here we are setting up the collection of
				pages that will always be a part of your portal. The
				file-system tree-like collection of pages is known as
				your
				<b>portal site</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				We provide a quick Ant task to copy in the new,
				preconfigured pages:
			</p>
			<source>
				<![CDATA[
# Linux	 
cd /JetspeedTraining/workspace/jetexpress/

# Windows
cd \JetspeedTraining\workspace\jetexpress\

ant copy-page-resources
     ]]>
			</source>
			<p>
				Open up some of the pages found under
				<i>portal/src/webapp/WEB-INF/pages/</i>
				. You will see that we've added a new
				<i>Contact Us</i>
				page, and added the some new demo portlets the the
				default page. We have also changed the default themes
				and decorators for all administrative pages.
			</p>
			<p>Go ahead and deploy those changes:</p>
			<source>
				<![CDATA[
ant
     ]]>
			</source>
			<p>
				This will deploy your new pages. Refresh the portal home
				page to see the new portlets:
			</p>
			<img src="tutorials/images/new-home.png" />
			<p>Likewise for the desktop:</p>
			<img src="tutorials/images/new-home2.png" />

			<p>
				Like many open source software packages, support is
				available from commercial companies that will provide a
				range of services. This gives users the same or better
				security and support than they get for proprietary
				solutions. Since the sources are publicly available and
				there is a strong community using and supporting
				Jetspeed, companies adopting Jetspeed are well
				protected.

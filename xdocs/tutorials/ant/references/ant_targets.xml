				Ant build files are a bit intimidating but are pretty easy to understand if they are well structured and you take the time to look at definitions carefully.
				Once you understand the existing tasks, you can add your own to automate tasks that are particular to your workflow.
				</p>
			</subsection>

		<section name="Build Properties">
			<p>
				It is a good practice in Ant to separate the task
				definitions from the specifics of your installation. Ant
				does this through a file called build.properties.
				Definitions put into this file are available for use in
				the build.xml file.
			</p>
			<p>
				This makes is easy to distribute an Ant build that is
				easy to customize. The person receiving the Ant build
				configuration can usually just modify the
				build.properties file to make the build work in their
				enviroment without having to look through each Ant goal
				to see where files are expected or where they are going
				to be put by the Ant Goal

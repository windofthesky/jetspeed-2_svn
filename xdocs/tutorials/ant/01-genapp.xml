			<p>
				Now that you have configured the basic portal, we are
				ready to build the portal installer. In the Navigator view,
				right-click on the build.xml in the root of the project.
				Select the "Run As", then "Build ...". Check to ensure
				that
				<em>create.installer</em>
				is selected and click on the "Run" button.
			</p>
			<p>Or, you can switch over to the command line, goto the jetexpress directory, and type <b>ant create.installer</b>.
			   There is also a <b>clean</b> target that should be used to clean out the previous build
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that we are building a minimal deployment. The Min deployment
				only creates a Jetspeed core portal and a Jetspeed Admin
				portlet application (j2-admin). When the build process
				completes, you should see the message
				<b>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</b>
				at the end of a large amount of build logging
				information The portal is built into a temp directory
				named
				<i>target</i>
				found directory under your
				<i>jetexpress</i>
				project directory.

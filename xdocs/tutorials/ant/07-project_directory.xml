			name="Overview of the Custom Portal Directory Structure">
			<p>
				The directory structure for developing a custom Jetspeed
				portal is designed to be similar to the directory
				structure of the Jetspeed-2 core source tree.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this directory structure only covers the
				custom portal itself. Each portlet is a separate project
				with its own directory structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is an overview of directories (directories are
				relative to the custom portal project root):
			</p>
			<div>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>
								<tt>directory</tt>
							</strong>
						</td>
						<td>
							<strong>
								<tt>explanation</tt>
							</strong>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>dist</td>
						<td>
							Distributable files(wars, jars) created
							during the build, such as installers or web
							applications
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>src/installer</td>

							Jetexpress installer

							portal (CSS, images, HTML)

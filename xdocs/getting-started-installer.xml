			<subsection name="Getting Started with the Installer">
			<p>
			Once you have <a href="download.html">downloaded</a> the intaller.  Jetspeed-2 provides 2 installers:
			<ul>
			<li>An installer with derby as an embedded database: 
			<a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/portals/binaries/Jetspeed2.0-derby-install.jar">Jetspeed2.0-derby-install.jar</a></li>
			<li>An installer for installing Jetspeed-2 on a third party database: 
			<a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/portals/binaries/Jetspeed2.0-MultiDb-install.jar">Jetspeed2.0-MultiDB-install.jar</a></li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			To install Jetspeed-2 with the installer, run depending on which installer you've downloaded:
			<source>
java -jar Jetspeed2.0-MultiDB-install.jar
or
java -jar Jetspeed2.0-derby-install.jar
			</source>
			</p>	
			<p>
			For the Multi-DB installer you will need to supply:
			<ul>
			<li>A username</li>
			<li>A password</li>
			<li>A JDBC connection string</li>
			<li>A JDBC driver name</li>
			<li>The location of a valid JDBC driver.  The installer will copy this to the installed location.</li>
			</ul>
			Finally the database must be empty because the installer does not know how to drop tables.
			</p>

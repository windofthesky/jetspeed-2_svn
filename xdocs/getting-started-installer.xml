			<subsection name="Getting Started with the Installer">
			<p>
			Once you have <a href="download.html">downloaded</a> the intaller.  Jetspeed-2 provides 2 installers:
			<ul>
			<li>An installer with derby as an embedded database: 
			<a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/portals/jetspeed-2/binaries/Jetspeed2.0-derby-install.jar">Jetspeed2.0-derby-install.jar</a></li>
			<li>An installer for installing Jetspeed-2 on a third party database: 
			<a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/portals/jetspeed-2/binaries/Jetspeed2.0-MultiDb-install.jar">Jetspeed2.0-MultiDB-install.jar</a></li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			To install Jetspeed-2 with the installer, run depending on which installer you've downloaded:
			<source>
java -jar Jetspeed2.0-MultiDB-install.jar
or
java -jar Jetspeed2.0-derby-install.jar
			</source>
			</p>	
			<p>
			For the Multi-DB installer you will need to supply:
			<ul>
			<li>A Database type. Valid values [derby, mssql, mysql, oracle, hsql, postgres, sapdb]</li>
			<li>A username</li>
			<li>A password</li>
			<li>A JDBC connection string</li>
			<li>A JDBC driver name</li>
			<li>The location of a valid JDBC driver.  The installer will copy this to the installed location.</li>
			</ul>
            With the exception of Derby, you will need to create an empty database schema in 
            your particular database to store the Jetspeed tables. With the exception of Derby, you can not run the 
		    installer twice against the same database schema. You have to manually drop the tables yourself before 
            running the installer a second time.

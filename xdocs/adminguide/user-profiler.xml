<section name='Principal Rules'>
<p>Each user principal can be mapped to specific profiling rule. This association is stored in the Jetspeed database.
The association is three-way, combining the PRINCIPAL + PROFILING RULE + LOCATOR, where the locator values 
currently supported are <quote>menu</quote> or <quote>page</quote>. Thus we can have two different profiling rules
applied for locating resources per user: locate pages and locate menus. When the profiler attempts to locate a page
for the current user, it will apply the profiling rule for the given user. The Jetspeed User Administration portlet
has a tab for editing user profile information:

</p>
<p>
Often, profiling rules are determined and then associated by portal-specific logic during user registration (or self-registration).    
A Jetspeed-specific self-registration portlet could handle the registration process of adding a user to the system, granting roles, 
setting user attributes, and assigning the profiling rule for the user.

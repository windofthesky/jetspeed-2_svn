      <p>
        Jetspeed-2 is provided with several Administrative Portlets, including for User Management.<br/>

        The User Info Test demo Portlet, default deployed in Jetspeed-2 and displayed on the start page, uses
        the above example User Attribute definitions and displays the values for the logged on user (also showing that
        these can be accessed from both the PortletRequest as well as the HttpServletRequest from within a servlet):</p>

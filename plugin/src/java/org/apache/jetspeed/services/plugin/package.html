<h2 align="center"> Jetspeed's Plugin Architecture </h2>
<h3>1. What is Thrust?</h3>
<p> Thrust is a simple architecture that allows developers to write pluggable/configurable 
  application modules based on standardized interface definitions that introduce 
  a low level of coupling and a high level of re-useability.</p>
<h3>2. What makes Thrust different than a service architecutre like Fulcrum?</h3>
<p>Service frameworks, like fulcrum, allow for only single implementation of a 
  specific interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust can have any number of named plugin's 
  that all implement the same interface. &nbsp;Services generally provide a high-level 
  business functionallity. Thrust modules should be small, and portable. Thrust 
  lends itself well to things like abstracting security implementations and persistence 
  mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust plugins would be used to support high-level functionallity 
  provided services.</p>

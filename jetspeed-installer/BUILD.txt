To build either of the installer, the Jetspeed Maven plugin for Maven-2 
should be used as follows:

> cd jetspeed-installer
> mvn jetspeed:mvn -Dtarget=installer

The self executing installer can be found in the maven target directory
after the build:

jetspeed-installer-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

It can be run simply enough:

> java -jar jetspeed-installer-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

There are two Jetspeed installers that can be built from command line: a portal
with minimal functionality and a demo portal with more portlet applications.

To build either of these installers, the Jetspeed Maven plugin for Maven-2 
should be used as follows:  

> mvn jetspeed:mvn -Dtarget=installer-minimal

  or	

> mvn jetspeed:mvn -Dtarget=installer-demo


NB: the target directory will be cleaned so you cannot build both installers at the same time
without saveguarding the first build target.

  <!-- 
      Creates a JNDI-based datasource bean name "JetspeedDS". The information
      provided here is merged with the basic configuration for the 
      jdbc-connection-descriptor with the matching jcd-alias property
      ("JetspeedDS") located under /etc/db-ojb/repository_database.xml in the
      source tree.

      Another requirement for this to work is to have the 
      ConnectionFactoryClass=org.apache.ojb.broker.accesslayer.ConnectionFactoryManagedImpl
      or to have
      ConnectionManagerClass=org.apache.jetspeed.components.rdbms.ojb.ConnectionManagerImpl.
      (either will do, both are recommended, see comments in configuration file).
      These properties are located in /etc/db-ojb/OJB.properties in the source tree.
          
      FYI: The two OJB configuration files mentioned above are currently already setup this way 
      in the default Jetspeed implementation.  
          
      However, if you need to locate/modify these files in a running instance of jetspeed,
      they will be located under /WEB-INF/classes.

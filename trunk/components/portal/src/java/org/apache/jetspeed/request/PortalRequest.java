/**
 * PortalRequest wraps the original request to the portal and keeps local
 * references to properties like contextPath, servletPath and the Session
 * when its created.
 * <p>
 * Some web servers like WebSphere don't store these properties inside the
 * request but derive them dynamically based on the web application context
 * in which they are invoked.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For cross-context invoked portlet applications, getting access to the
 * portal contextPath using requestContext.getRequest().getContextPath()
 * this clearly is a problem. Also, access to the Portal Session is not
 * possible this way.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The requestContext.request is actually wrapped by this class which solves
 * the problem by storing a reference to the actual properties at the time
 * of creation and returning

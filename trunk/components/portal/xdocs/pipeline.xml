            In Jetspeed-2, a request pipeline perform individual operations to the request.

            A <code>Pipeline</code> is made of <code>Value</code> chained together in a chain of reponsiblity pattern.
            The <code>JetspeedPipeline</code> implementation assembles a ordered list of <code>Valves</code> that are
            processed sequentially.

            Jetspeed-2 provides various type of <code>Valve</code> as illustrated below:<br/><br/>

			The above valves serve the following purpose:

            		<td>Check if <code>PortletAction</code> needs to be processed and process it, if required.
            		Used in the portlet pipeline.</td>

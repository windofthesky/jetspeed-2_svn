        <section name="Component Manager Overview">
            <p>
            The <code>ComponentManager</code> provides a layer of abstraction on top of the component framework that
            will be used by Jetspeed-2.  This provides a flexible architecture where the component framework used can
            easily be "swapped".  By default Jetspeed-2 uses the <a href="http://www.springframework.com">spring
            framework</a>.
            </p>
            <subsection name="Component Manager with Spring">
            <p>
            The <code>ComponentManager</code> delegates the initialization of the component framework engine
            to an implementation specific to the component framework as illustrated below.  The <code>SpringComponentManager</code>
            is responsible for initializing the spring engine and calls to spring components within the Jetspeed-2 engines are wrapped
            behind generic methods such as <code>getComponent()</code>.

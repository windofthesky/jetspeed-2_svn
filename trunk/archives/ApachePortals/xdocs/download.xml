<subsection name="Building The Source">
  <p>
    Be sure and read the GETTING-STARTED documentation for each Apache Portals project
    for instructions on how to build the project.
    Apache Portal projects require <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> as its 
    build system, and building is usually as simple as running 'maven' or 'maven jar:jar'
    at the top of the source directory. Builds vary on a per project basis.

      <p>
        The jetspeed-db:init Maven Plugin is capable of performing many database related tasks for initializing a (Jetspeed Portal) production database
        but can also be used for setting up database data needed for unit tests during an (integration) test build.          
      </p>
      <p>
        The following <em>independent</em> tasks can be configured:
        <ul>
          <li>unpacking of (remote) resource archives, like database (ddl) sql scripts</li>
          <li>executing selected sql scripts against the a database</li>
          <li>executing the jetspeed-serializer component for initializing a Jetspeed Portal database</li>
          <li>executing the jetspeed-serializer component for loading Jetspeed PSML in a database</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>

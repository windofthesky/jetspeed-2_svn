When developing with Jetspeed, you may be creating portlet applications, or building and creating extensions to the Jetspeed portal.
If you ar going to be creating portlet applications, check out this fine e-book for an overall guide to writing portlets:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.manning.com/hepper/' target='_blank'>Portlets and Apache Portals Book</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The core team of Jetspeed developers work directly with the source code, building the latest versions of Jetpeed. We welcome all software developers to work
with us. However, the full development process maybe overkill for your needs. If you simply want to create and build a customized Jetspeed portal, and make extensions to it,
check out the <i>Custom Build</i> section below. If you want to get more involved and start contributing to Jetspeed, see the section below on <i>Building from Source</i>
</p>
<p>Best place to get started developing Jetspeed is to read our <a href='http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/buildguide/index.html'  target='_blank'>Build Guide</a></p>
<p>Starting with Jetspeed 2.2, all Jetspeed building is with Maven-2. The 2.1 branch used to support Maven-1, Maven-2, and Ant. We have consolidated all features from all 2.1.x builds into one new, Maven-2 build for version 2.2 and beyond</p>  
<h2>Custom Building with Maven Plugins</h2>
<p>With the Jetspeed Custom build, you can actually build your own portal without the Jetspeed source. 
You will want to customize your Jetspeed build, overriding the skins and themes, adding your own portlet applications and perhaps overriding
key components of the portal. To do so, we provide a custom build framework extending Maven-2.
</p>
<p>With the custom build, you can easily build and create your own Jetspeed powered portal without ever building Jetspeed itself.</p>
<p>Creating a custom build of Jetspeed is probably the most common usage of Jetspeed. Documentation for using the Custom Build and Plugins can be found here:</p> 
<ul>
<li><a href='http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/buildguide/jetspeed-archetype.html'  target='_blank'>Jetspeed Custom Build with Maven</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Building from Source</h2>
<p>If you need to build the source, reference the Build Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/buildguide/maven-2-build.html' target='_blank'>Building Jetspeed from Source with Maven-2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Jetspeed is built from the command line with Maven. However, you can still develop, compile, debug, remote debug, all from within Eclipse.
Eclipse is a good tool for developing portlet applications as well as Jetspeed extensions.

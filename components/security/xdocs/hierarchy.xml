        <section name="Hierarchy Management Overview">
            <p>
                Two hierarchy resolution strategies are supported for authorization decisions:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hierarchy resolution by Generalization: This is the default hierarchy resolution in Jetspeed. If a hierarchy uses a generalization
                        strategy, each role is more general than the previous one. For instance, if a user has the role [roleA.roleB.roleC] then
                        <code>user.getSubject().getPrincipals()</code>
                        returns:
                        <ul>
                            <li>/role/roleA</li>
                            <li>/role/roleA/roleB</li>
                            <li>/role/roleA/roleB/roleC</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hierarchy resolution by Aggregation: If a hierarchy uses a aggregation strategy, the higher role is responsible for a superset of the
                        activities of the lower role. For instance, if the following roles are available:
                        <ul>
                            <li>roleA</li>
                            <li>roleA.roleB</li>
                            <li>roleA.roleB.roleC</li>
                        </ul>
                        If a user has the role [roleA] then,
                        <code>user.getSubject().getPrincipals()</code>
                        returns:
                        <ul>
                            <li>/role/roleA</li>
                            <li>/role/roleA/roleB</li>
                            <li>/role/roleA/roleB/roleC</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As described in the
                <a href="atz-spi.html">authorization SPI section</a>
                , the
                <code>SecurityMappingHandler</code>
                is configured with a specific hierarchy strategy for group and role hierarchy management. See the
                <a href="config.html#security-spi-atz_xml">authorization SPI configuration</a>
                for a configuration example.

        <section name="Leveraging Preferences to Manage Hierarchies">
            <p>
                The default hierarchy management implementation resolves the hierarchy strategy by leveraging Jetspeed 2's
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html">java.util.prefs.Preferences</a>
                implementation. The
                <code>Preferences</code>
                implementation provides the underlying structure in Jetspeed to store user attributes, and roles and groups definitions. The
                <code>Preferences</code>
                model provides a hierarchy model that is leveraged to store the base roles and groups hierarchy upon which various resolving strategies can be
                applied (resolution by generalization or aggregation).

            <subsection name="How does this work?">
                <p>
                    The
                    <code>SecurityMappingHandler</code>
                    implementation resolves the mappings between roles and groups. Let's say that we want to find out the roles mapping to a specific group
                    name. To do so, the
                    <code>SecurityMappingHandler</code>
                    implements a
                    <code>getRolePrincipalsInGroup(String groupFullPathName)</code>
                    method. In this method, the group name is mapped to a specific
                    <code>Preferences</code>
                    node. According to a given hierarchy resolution strategy (see
                    <a href="#Hierarchy_Management_Overview">overview section</a>
                    ), being in [group A] may mean belonging to a set of groups; the HierarchyResolver is used to do so as illustrated below:
                    <source>
                        <![CDATA[
public Set getRolePrincipalsInGroup(String groupFullPathName)
{
   ...
   Preferences preferences = Preferences.userRoot().node(
       GroupPrincipalImpl.getFullPathFromPrincipalName(groupFullPathName));
   String[] fullPaths = groupHierarchyResolver.resolve(preferences);
   ...
}]]>
                    </source>
                    The resulting groups are then used to find all associated roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result of this implementation, the name of a role principal (<code>Principal</code> 
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/security/Principal.html#getName()">getName()</a>) 
                    in the security layer should match the full path of that user preferences
                    root in the preferences layer (<code>Preference</code> 
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html#absolutePath()">absolutePath()</a>; e.g:
                    <code>/role/theRolePrincipal</code>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Group and roles hierarchy are stored in the
                    <code>Preferences</code>
                    layer as follow (the output of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html#exportNode(java.io.OutputStream)">
                    exportNode()</a> for Jetspeed's RBMS <code>Preferences</code> implementation):
                    <source>
                        <![CDATA[
<preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION="1.0">
<root type="user">
<map />
    <node name="group1">
    <map />
        <node name="groupid1.1">
        <map />
	    <node name="groupid1.1.1">
            <map />
            </node>
        </node>
    </node>

    <node name="role1">
    <map />
        <node name="roleid1.1">
        <map />
	    <node name="roleid1.1.1">
            <map />
            </node>
        </node>
    </node>
</root>]]>
                    </source>
                    This structure would define the following group and role hierarchy:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>/group1/groupid1.1/groupid1.1.1</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/role1/roleid1.1/roleid1.1.1</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Additionally, in this model, the
                    <code>map</code>
                    element can define groups or roles custom properties. For instance, a role could have a rule custom property (or a pointer to a rule) that
                    allow rule based role definition tied to some rule engine (Drools for instance) and is validated when the isInRole method is invoked. For
                    groups, a portal could use group to describe organization and have custom property such as address, city, etc. associated with the
                    organization/group.

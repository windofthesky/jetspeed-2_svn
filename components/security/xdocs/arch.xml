                Jetspeed 2 security leverages J2EE authentication and authorization standards for both authentication 
                and authorization through the implementation of a default <code>LoginModule</code> and a default authorization
                <code>Policy</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authentication establishes the identity of the user and populates the <code>Subject</code> with all
                the user principals.  In a portal context, the populated <code>Subject</code> is added to the session
                in the <code>org.apache.jetspeed.security.SecurityValve</code> implementation.  The <code>Subject</code>
                principals are then used to authorize the user's access to a given resource.  It leverages JAAS authorization
                by checking the user's permission with the
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/security/AccessController.html">AccessController</a>.  More details
                on authorization are provided in the <a href="atz-jaas.html">JAAS authorization section</a> of this documentation.
            </p>

                Configuration files for each component areas are specified.  For more information, go to the documentation
                section on <a href="config.html">configuration</a>.

            <p>
                Jetspeed security architecture is fully JAAS compliant.  Developers can replace Jetspeed security
                architecture with their own <code>LoginModule</code> and <code>Policy</code> implementation.  Jetspeed
                implementation provides management programming and user interfaces as well as an SPI model to facilitate
                its extension.

<!-- doctype definition
     By default we are using a local DTD that is expected to reside
     in the same directory as this repository.xml file.
     If you intend to validate your repository.xml against
     the public dtd at the Apache site, please replace the string
     "repository.dtd"
     by the public adress
     "http://db.apache.org/ojb/dtds/1.0/repository.dtd".
     In this case validation will only work if the machine you
     run your application on can connect to the internet!

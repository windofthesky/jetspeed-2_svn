Localization files in this directory are in 'native' format.
These files must be processed, by native2ascii, before committing.
In case anyone needs the original format, they are here.
For example ua-windows-1251 contains property files in Cp1251.
ua-windows-1251 folder contains sources, before running native2ascii
I think building process should process these files to ascii and then
package them to application archives. However, we do not yet have this process in place.

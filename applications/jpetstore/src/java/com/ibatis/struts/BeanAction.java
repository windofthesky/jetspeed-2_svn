/**
 * BeanAction is an extension to the typical Struts Action class that
 * enables mappings to bean methods.  This allows for a more typical
 * Object Oriented design where each object has behaviour as part of
 * its definition.  Instead of writing separate Actions and Forms,
 * BeanAction allows you to simply have a Bean, which models both
 * the state and the methods that operate on that state.
 * <p/>
 * In addition to the simpler packaging, BeanAction also simplifies the
 * Struts progamming paradigm and reduces dependency on Struts.  Using
 * this pattern could allow easier migration to newer frameworks like JSF.
 * <p/>
 * The method signatures are greatly simplified to the following
 * <pre>
 * public String myActionMethod() {
 *   //..work
 *   return "success";
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The return parameter becomes simply the name of the forward (as defined
 * in the config file as usual).  Form parameters, request, response, session,
 * attributes, and cookies are all accessed via the ActionContext class (see the
 * ActionContext javadocs for more).
 * <p/>
 * The forms that you map to a BaseAction mapping must be a subclass of the
 * BaseBean class.  BaseBean continues to simplify the validation and
 * reset methods by removing the parameters from the signature as was done with
 * the above action method example.
 * <p/>
 * There are 3 ways to map a BeanAction in the struts configuration file.
 * They are as follows.
 * <p/>
 * <B>URL Pattern</B>
 * <p/>
 * This approach uses the end of the action definition to determine which
 * method to call on the Bean.  For example if you request the URL:
 * <p/>
 * http://localhost/jpetstore4/shop/viewOrder.do
 * <p/>
 * Then the method called would be "viewOrder" (of the mapped bean as specified
 * by the name="" parameter in the mapping below).  The mapping used for this
 * approach is as follows.
 * <pre>
 *  &lt;action path="/shop/<b>viewOrder</b>" type="com.ibatis.struts.BeanAction"
 *    name="orderBean" scope="session"
 *    validate="false"&gt;
 *    &lt;forward name="success" path="/order/ViewOrder.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <B>Method Parameter</B>
 * <p/>
 * This approach uses the Struts action parameter within the mapping
 * to determine the method to call on the Bean.  For example the
 * following action mapping would cause the "viewOrder" method to
 * be called on the bean ("orderBean").  The mapping used for this
 * approach is as follows.
 * <pre>
 *  &lt;action path="/shop/viewOrder" type="com.ibatis.struts.BeanAction"
 *    <b>name="orderBean" parameter="viewOrder"</b> scope="session"
 *    validate="false"&gt;
 *    &lt;forward name="success" path="/order/ViewOrder.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <B>No Method call</B>
 * <p/>
 * BeanAction will ignore any Struts action mappings without beans associated
 * to them (i.e. no name="" attribute in the mapping).  If you do want to associate
 * a bean to the action mapping, but do not want a method to be called, simply
 * set the parameter to an asterisk ("*").  The mapping used for this approach
 * is as follows (no method will be called).
 * <pre>
 *  &lt;action path="/shop/viewOrder" type="com.ibatis.struts.BeanAction"
 *    <b>name="orderBean" parameter="*"</b> scope="session"
 *    validate="false"&gt;
 *    &lt;forward name="success" path="/order/ViewOrder.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <B>A WORK IN PROGRESS</B>
 * <p/>
 * <i>The BeanAction Struts extension is a work in progress.  While it demonstrates
 * good patterns for application development, the framework itself is very new and
 * should not be considered stable.  Your comments and suggestions are welcome.
 * Please visit <a href="http://www.ibatis.com">http://www.ibatis.com</a> for contact information.</i>

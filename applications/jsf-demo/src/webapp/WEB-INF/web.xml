        <description>
            This parameter tells MyFaces if javascript code should be allowed in the
            rendered HTML output.
            If javascript is allowed, command_link anchors will have javascript code
            that submits the corresponding form.
            If javascript is not allowed, the state saving info and nested parameters
            will be added as url parameters.
            Default: "true"

            This parameter tells MyFaces if javascript code should be allowed in the

            will be added as url parameters.
            Default: "false"

            Setting this param to true should be combined with STATE_SAVING_METHOD "server" for
            best results.

            This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature. You also have to enable the detector filter/filter mapping below to get
            JavaScript detection working.

        <description>
            If true, rendered HTML code will be formatted, so that it is "human readable".
            i.e. additional line separators and whitespace will be written, that do not
            influence the HTML code.
            Default: "true"

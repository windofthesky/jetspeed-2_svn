<p>
The Profiler locates portal resources given a set of request parameters, properties, and attributes
The Profiler is invoked during the request processing pipeline.
It requires that the request context is already populated with the portal request and response,
and capability and user information. The request context parameters, properties and attributes
make up the profile criterion which the profiler uses to locate portal resources:
<ul>
<li>page
<li>navigations
<li>document lists
</ul>
 The profiler does not actually locate the document.
 It creates a Profile Locator, an abstract definition of a resource locator.
</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
Rules define how a resource locator is created.
A rule is an ordered sequence of one or more criterion.
The profiler will apply all criteria for a given rule in fallback order.
It will start from the lowest fallback number for a criteria, and continue
trying to locate until it either locates a resource, or until the fallback type of the
criteria dictates that it either stop or continue to loop.
<h2>Resolvers</h2>
Resolvers are Java classes associated with a criterion. 
A resolver determines what runtime parameters and state to look at when building a profile locator.

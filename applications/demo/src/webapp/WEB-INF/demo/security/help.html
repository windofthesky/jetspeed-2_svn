<h3>Example user role configuration</h3>

<p>
  To be able to test the Role Security Test Portlet one or more users should be
  assigned the role of <code>admin</code>, <code>manager</code> and/or 
  <code>user</code>.
</p>
<p>
  At this moment, only the default Tomcat MemoryRealm has been tested. For this
  realm, users and their roles are defined in tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
</p>
<p>
  An example tomcat-users.xml for testing this portlet might look like:
  <pre>
    &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
    &lt;tomcat-users&gt;
      &lt;role rolename="user"/&gt;
      &lt;role rolename="manager"/&gt;
      &lt;role rolename="admin"/&gt;
      &lt;role rolename="tomcat"/&gt;
      &lt;user username="tomcat"  password="tomcat"  roles="tomcat"/&gt;
      &lt;user username="user"    password="user"    roles="user"/&gt;
      &lt;user username="manager" password="manager" roles="manager,user"/&gt;
      &lt;user username="admin"   password="admin"   roles="admin,manager,user"/&gt;
    &lt;/tomcat-users&gt;
  </pre>
</p>

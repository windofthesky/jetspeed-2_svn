Setting up the php demo
------------------------------

The php demo uses a backed database (MySQL) that simulates
a simple machine database.

Setup
-----
the php file in hosts/conf/config.php defines the database and
the connection parameter that the application will use. Change
it to your needs.

Create a database (I used hosts) and populate it with the script
found in sql/php-demo.sql

The php-demo portlet is configured to use the following start page:
hosts/index.php

That's it!

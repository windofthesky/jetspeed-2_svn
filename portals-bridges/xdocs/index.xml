      Portals Bridges provides support for <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168" target="_nw">JSR-168</a> compliant
      Portlet development using common web frameworks like Struts, JSF, PHP, Perl and Velocity.  
      </p>
      <subsection name="JavaServer Faces">
      <p>
      JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications can be run within an Portlet environment with little or no changes using the
      the <a href="multiproject/portals-bridges-jsf/index.html">JSF bridge</a> which provides a JSFPortlet ready to be deployed.
      </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Struts and PHP">
      </subsection>
      <p>
      Pure servlet based frameworks like Struts or PHP 4 (with the Java binding) are very difficult to use in a
      Portlet environment because they only support and understand a single request event.
      </p>
      <p>
      For a Portlet, the request processing has to be handled in two separated action and render events. Furthermore,
      the Portlet Specification doesn't allow servlet access during the action request event.
      </p>
      <p>
      A distinctive feature of the Portals Bridges is that it removes these barriers and thereby allows the mapping of
      an action request event to the underlying servlet handler implementation (e.g. a StrutsAction).
      </p>
      <p>
      All that is needed is an implementation of the generic ServletContextProvider interface, provided with The Portals
      Bridges <a href="multiproject/portals-bridges-common/index.html">Common</a> library, for a specific Portal.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <a href="multiproject/portals-bridges-struts/index.html">Portals Struts Bridge</a> furthermore provides a truly transparent mapping of the two request events
      onto the underlying Struts Action mappings and enables an existing Struts Application to be run within a Portlet context
      with very little changes.
      </p>
      <p>

      <subsection name="Velocity">
      <p>
      Although JavaServer Pages (JSP) are very much promoted for Portlet View rendering, other technologies can be
      used just as easily. The <a href="multiproject/portals-bridges-velocity/index.html">Portals Velocity Bridge</a> provides several ready to use Velocity based
      Portlets, together with a library of useful scripts. 
      </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Perl">
      <p>
      Perl based web applications can be accessed as a Portlet using the <a href="multiproject/portals-bridges-perl/index.html">Portals Perl Bridge</a>.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Common Utilities and Interfaces">
      <p>
      The <a href="multiproject/portals-bridges-common/index.html">Portals Bridges Common</a> library provides, besides
      the already mentioned ServletContextProvider interface, several additional utilities like a GenericServletPortlet
      which you can use for simple JSP based Portlets (or any invokable view Render technology). Or use it as base
      class for your own Bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
      Other useful utilities included are a PreferenceHelper and a simple PortletMessaging component.

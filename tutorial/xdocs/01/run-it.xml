    <section name="Running a Custom Jetspeed Portal">
      <p>      
       Running the portal is very straight forward. In this tutorial we are running our Jetspeed portal in a Tomcat application server.
       To start up the portal, go to the command line and enter:
      </p>
	 <source>
	 <![CDATA[
cd tomcat-express
cd bin
# Windows
startup.bat 
# Linux
./startup.sh
     ]]>
	</source> 
      <p>
      The first time we run the portal, its going to take a minute or so to complete the initial deployment of the portal and Admin portlet application.       
      </p>	
      <p>
      Open up a browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/jetexpress/portal">http://localhost:8080/jetexpress/portal</a>
      </p>
	  <p>
	   You should see the minimal core Jetspeed portal as shown below. Login with the credentials <b>admin/admin</b>. You will be prompted
	   to change the admin password. As you can see, this is a boiler plate, minimal portal. Press the Next button to get started on customizing
	   Jetspeed.

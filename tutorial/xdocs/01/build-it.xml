      <p>      
       Now that you have generated a custom portal named <b>jetexpress</b>, we are ready to build the portal.
       We are going to build the portal from the command line:
      </p>
	 <source>
	 <![CDATA[
# Linux	 
cd /JetspeedTraining/workspace/jetexpress  	 

# Windows
cd \JetspeedTraining\workspace\jetexpress  	 

mvn install
mvn jetspeed:mvn -Dtarget=proddb
mvn jetspeed:mvn -Dtarget=deploy
     ]]>
	</source> 
      <p>
      We are building jetexpress(Customized jetspeed portal) and portlet application. When the build process completes, you should see the message <b>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</b> at the end of a large amount of build logging information      
      The portal is built into a temp directory named <i>target</i> found directory under your <i>jetexpress</i> project directory.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>Above command will deploy the deploys Jetexpress and create database on defined location and database, as specified in last step</li>
      <li>creates the Jetspeed core schema tables in the Derby database</li>
      <li>populates the database with a minimal set of portal information, including default roles, groups, profiles, and administrative users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Now that we've built and deployed the portal, lets start up the application server...

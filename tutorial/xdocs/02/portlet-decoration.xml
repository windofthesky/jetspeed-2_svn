      <p> 
      Each Jetspeed portlet window on a page can be associated with a different portlet decoration. 
      Portlet decorations control some important aspect of a portlet window:
      <ul>
      <li>The colors, images, CSS styles that skin this window</li>
      <li>The title portion of the portlet</li>
      <li>The borders of the window</li>
      <li>Action buttons displayed on the window</li>
      </ul>      
      Jetspeed comes with several portlet decorations out of the box. The default page decorator for 
      most pages is called <i>tigris</i>. It looks like this:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/tigris-portlet.png"/>
      <p>
      We are going to create a new decorator for this tutorial.
      This new decorator can be copied into our project from the <i>/JetspeedTutorial/resources/decorations/portlet/express-portlet/</i> directory.
      This will save you the trouble of creating all the logo images and CSS definitions.
      </p>

     We are going to skip over the intricate details of portlet decorators, as page decorators are much more 
     important, as they set your organization's branding. Whereas the standard window decorators are good 
     enough for getting you started. Go ahead and review the content of our custom portlet decorator.
     You will see that the directory layout is the same as for page decorators. The decorator simply
     creates a new color variation on an existing window decorator.

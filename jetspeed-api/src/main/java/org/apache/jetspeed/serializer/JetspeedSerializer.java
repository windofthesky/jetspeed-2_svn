/**
 * Jetspeed Serializer
 * <p>
 * The Serializer is capable of reading and writing the current content of the
 * Jetspeed environment to and from XML files. The component can be used from a
 * standalone java application for seeding a new database or from a running
 * portal as an administrative backup/restore function.
 * <p>
 * The XML file needs to indicate whether passwords used in credentials
 * are plain text or whether they are encoded. The import algoritm can determine -
 * prior to reading users - which encode/decode scheme was used and if <none> or
 * <implements PasswordEncodingService> then we store plain passwords (Note that
 * that alone requires the resulting XML to be encoded!!!!!)

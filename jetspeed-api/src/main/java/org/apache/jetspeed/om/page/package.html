<body>
<p>
This package represents an Object Model for manipulating
portal "pages" describing the layout process for a specific
page to the aggregation engine.
</p>
<p>
The use of these pages is optional in Jetspeed 2 since it's
possible to include portlets directly within a JSp page
through the portlet taglib.
</p>
<p>
However, without a supporting page, Jetspeed does not provide
any built-in support for page customization.

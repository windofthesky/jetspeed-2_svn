Here is a list of stuff that you can work on if you find it interesting

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* PAM *
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- refactor PAM maven tasks to simply copy WAR to a deploy directory
- Move PAM into portal runtime. A directory watcher will pick up new deployments
  and kickoff the PAM to actually do the deployment.
  This implies that the portal server must be running to pick up a deployment
- remove funky code to look in the $HOME directory for the database path (yech)

ASSIGNED:

* Pooling *
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All Pluto factory objects such as request, response, dispatchers, invokers, contexts need to be pooled

ASSIGNED: DST

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Database *
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Consider using PA-NAME + PORTLET-NAME as a unique key to find portlets
  Currently it is, which can't make queries like SELECT NAME FROM PORTLET_DEFINITION run too fast.
    UNIQUE(APPLICATION_ID, NAME)
- Rework the way we find the database. Having a property in the $HOME directory isn't going to cut it

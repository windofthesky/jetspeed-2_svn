Pluto doesn't provide full-fidelity of the portlet.xml
A lot of short-cuts are taken
This document lists all known issues


PortletDefinition
-----------------
1. expirationCache, why String? (Pluto)

2. Display Name doesn't have language support (array)
    Look at Paul's Castor implementation, already solved
        see old model: org.apache.jetspeed.om.common.base.BaseDisplayName

3. Description is missing
    It also uses an array based on language
    see old model: org.apache.jetspeed.om.common.impl.CastorJdoPortletDescription

4. Supports ID is not stored
        <supports id="Minimal support">

5. Not tested or mapped
<xs:element name="supported-locale" type="portlet:supported-localeType" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
<xs:element name="resource-bundle" type="portlet:resource-bundleType" minOccurs="0"/>
<xs:element name="security-role-ref" type="portlet:security-role-refType" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>

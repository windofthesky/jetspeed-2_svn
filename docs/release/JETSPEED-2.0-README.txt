Release Notes
---------------------------
1. RSS Portlet requires xalan-2.4.1.jar in common/lib of Tomcat
   If you are running Java 1.5, you will need to copy the xalan-2.3.jar there
   from your jetspeed/WEB-INF/lib directory.

2. The User Registration and Forgotten Password Portlets require an SMTP server 
   to function. The default settings are configured to a mail server on localhost
   with no username or password. To change these settings, edit the Spring configuration
   for the mailSender component, located in the jetspeed/WEB-INF/assembly/administration.xml file.

3. Multi-Database installer Notes

   a. Valid values for the 'database type':
		derby 
		mssql
		mysql
		oracle

   b. With the exception of Derby, you will need to create an empty database schema in 
      your particular database to store the Jetspeed tables.
      
   c. With the exception of Derby, you can not run the installer twice against the 
     same database schema. You have to manually drop the tables yourself before

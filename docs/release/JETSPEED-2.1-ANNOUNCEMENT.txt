Subject: Jetspeed 2.1 Final Released

Message:

The Apache Portals Jetspeed Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Jetspeed 2.1 Open Source Enterprise Portal. 

Jetspeed is an Open Portal Platform and Enterprise Information Portal, written all in open source under the Apache license in Java and XML. 
Jetspeed is an open component architecture based on standards. All access to the portal is managed through a robust portal security policy. 
Within a Jetspeed portal, individual portlets can be aggregated to create a page. Each portlet is an independent application with Jetspeed 
acting as the central hub making information from multiple sources available in an easy to use manner.

Version 2.1 continues the evolution of the Jetspeed portal technology, with a more stabilized codebase.
The release includes many new features including Web 2.0 client-side aggregator, portlet and distributed caching, parallel aggregation, and
many more improvements and bug fixes.

This final release is fully-compliant with the Portlet Specification 1.0 (JSR-168).

The Jetspeed team will be presenting the new 2.1 release at ApacheCon Europe 2007 in Amsterdam.

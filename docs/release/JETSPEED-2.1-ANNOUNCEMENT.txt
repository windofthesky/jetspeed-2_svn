The Apache Portals Jetspeed Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Jetspeed 2.1 Open Source Enterprise Portal. 

Jetspeed is an Open Portal Platform and Enterprise Information Portal, written all in open source under the Apache license in Java and XML.

acting as the central hub making information from multiple sources available in an easy to use manner.

Version 2.1 continues the evolution of the Jetspeed portal technology, with a more stabilized codebase.
This release includes many new features including Web 2.0 client-side aggregator, distributed portal and portlet caching,
parallel rendering and aggregation, and many more improvements and bug fixes.

This final release is fully-compliant with the Portlet Specification 1.0 (JSR-168).

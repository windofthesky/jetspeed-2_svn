<a name="1"><h3>1. Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
<b>Apache Portals</b> is a collaborative software development project dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, 
commercial-quality, and freely available Portal related software on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.
This project is managed in cooperation with various individuals worldwide (both independent and company-affiliated experts), 
who use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop Portal software and related documentation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Apache Portals</b> is also known as <b>portals.apache.org</b>, located at <b>http://portals.apache.org</b>
</p> 
<p>
This charter describes the mission, history, organization, and processes of the project.
</p>
<a name="2"><h3>2. Mission</h3></a>
<p>

</p>
<a name="3"><h3>3. History</h3></a>
<p>
This project was established under the direction of the Apache Software Foundation in January 2004
to facilitate joint open-source development of portal software.
</p>
<a name="4"><h3>4. Organization</h3></a>
<p>
<b>portals.apache.org</b> exists as an umbrella project for sub-projects and as a ground for introducing new projects
and portal applications at Apache. At the time of the writing of this charter, the following projects
are included in the Apache Portals project from Jakarta:
<ul>
<li>Cocoon Portal
<li>Cornerstone (CPS)
<li>Jetspeed-1
<li>Jetspeed-2
<li>Pluto
<li>WSRP-4J
</ul>
</p>

<a name="5"><h3>5. The Project Management Committee</h3></a>
5.1 The <b>portals.apache.org project</b> is managed by a small, core group of
contributors known as the Project Management Committee [PMC], with representation from all sub-projects.  
<p>
5.2 The activities of the PMC are coordinated by the Chairperson,
who is an officer of the corporation and reports to the Apache
Board.  The Chairperson will, on the request of the Apache Board, 
provide reports to the Board on issues related  to the running of 
the portals.apache.org project. 
<p>
5.3 The PMC has the following responsibilities:
<p>
a) Accepting new subproject proposals, formally submitting these proposals for committer vote, 
and creating the subproject (see SUBPROJECTS below). 
This is done in collaboration with the Incubator (see <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">http://incubator.apache.org</a>).
<p>
b) Facilitating code or other donations by individuals or companies in collaboration with the Incubator.
<p>
c) Resolving license issues and other legal issues in conjunction with the ASF board.
<p>
d) Ensuring that administrative and infrastructure work is completed.
<p>
e) Facilitating relationships among projects and subprojects.
<p>
f) Facilitating relationships between portals.apache.org and the external world.
<p>
g) Overseeing portals.apache.org to ensure that the mission defined in this document is being fulfilled.
<p>
h) Resolving conflicts within the project.
<p>
i) Reporting to the ASF board (through the Chair) on the progress of the project.
<p>
5.4 To become a member of the PMC, an individual must be nominated by a
contributor, unanimously approved by all PMC members, and approved by
a two-thirds majority of committers. In most cases, developers will
have actively contributed to development for at least six months
before being considered for membership on the PMC. 
<p>
5.5 In cases where the sub-project is unable to directly provide a 
representative on the PMC, another member of the PMC will be required 
to represent that sub-project on the PMC.  This will be strongly
discouraged.  It is preferable that all sub-projects have direct 
representation on the PMC.
<p>
5.6 Once the PMC selection process has completed, the PMC will provide 
a recommendation to the Apache Board for the position of Chairperson 
of the PMC. 
<p>
5.7 This recommendation will be made on the basis of an election held 
within the PMC.  The election will be performed using a simple
majority vote of PMC members.
<p>
5.8 Upon agreement by the Apache Board, the recommended Chairperson will, 
if they are not already, be appointed an officer of the corporation.  
See <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html</a> for more information.
<p>
5.9 In the unlikely event that a member of the PMC becomes disruptive to
the process, ceases to make codebase contributions for an extended 
period, or ceases to take part in PMC votes for an extended period of
time, said member may be removed by unanimous vote of remaining PMC members.
<p>
5.10 The PMC is responsible for maintaining and updating this
charter. Development must follow the process outlined below, so any
change to the development process necessitates a change to the
charter. Changes must be unanimously approved by all members of the
PMC. A contributor may challenge a change to the charter at any time
and ask for a vote of all portals.apache.org active committers, in which
case a two-thirds majority must approve the change.

<a name="6"><h3>6. SubProjects</h3></a>

6.1 portals.apache.org is comprised of subprojects; a subproject is
responsible for component or application whose scope is well defined.  
Each subproject has its own set of developers, and is responsible 
for approving its own committers.
<p>
6.2 A new subproject proposal is submitted to the PMC, and then accepted
by a majority portals.apache.org active committer vote.
<p>
6.3 A subproject may be removed by unanimous vote of the PMC, subject to the
approval of the ASF board.  A contributor may challenge the removal of a 
subproject at any time and ask for a vote of all active committers, in
which case a two-thirds majority must approve the change.
<p>
<p>
<a name="7"><h3>7. Contributors</h3></a>

7.1 Like all Apache projects, the Portals project is a meritocracy -- the more
work you do, the more you are allowed to do. Contributions will include participating in 
mailing lists, reporting bugs, providing patches and proposing changes to a product.
<p>

7.2 Developers who make regular and substantial contributions may become
committers as described below.
<p>

<a name="8"><h3>8. Committers</h3></a>

8.1 Each subproject has a set of committers. Committers are contributors who
have read/write access to the source code repository. New committers
are added when a contributor is nominated by a committer and approved by
at least three of the active committers for that subproject with no
opposing votes.  In most cases, new committers will already be
participating in the development process by submitting suggestions
and/or fixes via the bug report page or mailing lists.
<p>
8.2 For the purposes of voting, committers will be classed as "active" or
"inactive". Only active committers will be included in the totals used to 
determine the success or failure of a particular vote.
<p>
8.3 Committers remain active as long as they are contributing code or
posting to the subproject mailing lists.  If a committers has neither
contributed code nor posted to the subproject mailing lists in 3
months, the PMC representatives for that subproject will e-mail the 
committer, the subproject development list, and the PMC mailing list 
notifying the committer that they are going to be moved to inactive 
status.  If there is no response in 72 hours, the committer will become 
inactive.
<p>
8.4 An inactive status will not prevent a committer committing new code
changes or posting to the mailing lists.  Either of these activities will
automatically re-activate the committer for the purposes of voting.
<p>
<a name="9"><h3>9. Infrastructure</h3></a>

9.1 The portals.apache.org project site must provide the following:
<p>
a) Bug Database -- This is a system for tracking bugs and feature
requests.

<p>
b) Subproject Source Repositories -- These are several CVS repositories
containing both the source code and documentation for the
subprojects. Each subproject will have a set of committers to its
repository.
<p>
c) Website -- An portals.apache.org website will contain information about
the portals.apache.org project, including documentation, downloads of
releases, and this charter. Each subproject will have its own website
with subproject information.
<p>
d) PMC Mailing List -- This list is for PMC business requiring
confidentiality, particularly when an individual or company requests
discretion. All other PMC business should be done on the general
mailing list.
<p>
e) General Mailing List -- This mailing list is open to the public. It is
intended for discussions that cross subprojects.
<p>
f) Subproject Mailing Lists -- Each subproject should have a devoted mailing
list. Many subprojects may wish to have both user and development
lists. The individual subprojects may decide on the exact structure of
their mailing lists.
<p>
<a name="10"><h3>10. Licensing</h3></a>

10.1 All contributions to the portals.apache.org project adhere to the 
"ASF Source Code License." All further contributions must be made under the
same terms. All contributed files must contain the full text of the ASF 
Source Code License.
<p>
<a name="11"><h3>11. The Development Process</h3></a>

11.1 The development process is intentionally lightweight; like other
Apache projects, the committers decide which changes may be committed
to the repository. Three +1 ('yes' votes) with no -1 ('no' votes or
vetoes) are needed to approve a code change. For efficiency, some code
changes from some contributors (e.g. feature additions, bug fixes) may
be approved in advance, in which case they may be committed first and
changed as needed, with conflicts resolved by majority vote of the
committers.
<p>
<a name="12"><h3>12. SubProject Requirements</h3></a>

12.1 Each subproject must have a set of requirements as well as an
up-to-date release plan and design document on its dedicated web page.
<p>
12.2 It is recommended that each subproject have a smoke-test system 
that works at least as a basic integration test.
<p>
<a name="13"><h3>13. Relationship to other Apache Projects</h3></a>

13.1 The portals.apache.org project should work closely with other Apache
projects, such as XML, Jakarta and the Apache Server, to avoid redundancy
and achieve a coherent architecture among portals.apache.org and these
projects.

<a name="14"><h3>14 Terms and Definitions</h3></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Portal</b> - A portal is a web based application that –commonly- provides personalization, single
sign on, content aggregation from different sources and hosts the presentation layer of 
Information Systems. Aggregation is the action of integrating content from different
sources within a web page. A portal may have sophisticated personalization features to
provide customized content to users. Portal pages may have different set of portlets
creating content for different users.
<li><b>Portlet</b> - A portlet is a Java technology based web component, managed by a portlet container, that
processes requests and generates dynamic content. Portlets are used by portals as
pluggable user interface components that provide a presentation layer to Information
Systems.
<li><b>Portlet Application</b> - Portlets, servlets and JSPs are bundled in an extended web application called portlet
application. Portlets, servlets and JSPs within the same portlet application share
classloader, application context and session.

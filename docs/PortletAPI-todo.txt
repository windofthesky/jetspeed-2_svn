Pluto Issues
---------------------------------
1. ServletObjectAccess 
    called from JetspeedPortletWrapper.renderPortlet
    which then calls FactoryManager.getFactory
    which then calls PortletContainerServices.get
    and if createReference isnt called on PortletContainerServices,
    then the factory service (RequestWrapper) is not found
    It appears that the createReference is only called from the Pluto container
    so Im not sure how Pluto accesses factories before the container is called per thread.
    But it seems to work in Pluto. Cant figure this one out yet

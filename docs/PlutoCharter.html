Pluto is a collaborative software development project dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, comercial-quality, and freely available Java Portlet Specification compliant portlet container.</p><h4>1.1 The Java Portlet Specification</h4><p> The portlet specification defines a set of APIs for portal computing addressing the areas of aggregation, personalization, presentation and security. Additionally, the specification defines portlets, the portlet container behavior, invocation of portlets, portlet services, the portlet event model, and other relevant entities and interfaces. Pluto implements the  portlet container enabling interoperability between portlets and portals.The portlet specification was initiated by IBM and SUN and developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 168. For more information see http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168.</p><p> As part of this JSR a reference implementation of the portlet container,which is the run-time environment for portlets, will be created. ThePluto project is the open source reference implementation for the Java PortletSpecification.</p>   <h3>2 MISSION</h3><p>2.1 To provide the reference implementation for the Java Portlet Specification under the ASF license.</p><p>2.2 To promote the use of portlet applications. We view portlets as an important technology in the growing portal and web application environments.  We intend to build a freely available portlet container in order to promote the use of this technology.</p><p>2.3 To server as the foundation for other Apache projects such as Jetspeed and WSRP4J. To provide a robust portlet container for use by this other projects, and to satisfy the requirements from other Apache projects that rely upon Pluto.</p><h3>3 TERMS</h3><p>3.1 <b>PMC</b> - The Jakarta PMC is a management board for project at the Jakarta project at the Apache Software Foundation.</p><p>3.2 <b>Project</b> The Jakarta Pluto Project, referred to as "jakarta.apache.org/pluto" or "Pluto" is a sub-project of the Jakarta project at the Apache Software Foundation.<p><p>3.3 <b>Contributor</b> Anyone who makes a contribution to the developmentof the ws.apache.org project or a subproject.<p><p>3.4 <b>Committer</b> Each Jakarta subproject has a set of committers.  Committersare contributors who have read/write access to the source coderepository.<p><h3>4 THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</h3><p>Since Pluto is a subproject of Jakarta, it will be managed by the Jakarta PMC.</p><h3>5 CONTRIBUTORS</h3><p>5.1 Like all Apache projects, the Pluto project is a meritocracy -- the morework you do, the more you are allowed to do. Contributions will include participating in mailing lists, reporting bugs, providing patches and proposing changes to a product.</p><p>5.2 Developers who make regular and substantial contributions may becomecommitters as described below.</p><h3>6 COMMITTERS</h3><p>6.1 Committers are contributors who have read/write access to the sourcecode repository. New committers are added when a contributor is nominatedby a committer and approved by at least three of the active committers forthat subproject with no opposing votes. In most cases, new committers willalready be participating in the development process by submittingsuggestions and/or fixes via the bug report page or mailing lists.</p><p>6.2 For the purposes of voting, committers will be classed as "active" or"inactive". Only active committers will be included in the totals used todetermine the success or failure of a particular vote.</p><p>6.3 Committers remain active as long as they are contributing code orposting to the subproject mailing lists. If a committers has neithercontributed code nor posted to the subproject mailing lists in 3 months,the PMC representatives for that subproject will e-mail the committer, thesubproject development list, and the PMC mailing list notifying thecommitter that they are going to be moved to inactive status. If there isno response in 72 hours, the committer will become inactive.</p><p>6.4 An inactive status will not prevent a committer committing new codechanges or posting to the mailing lists. Either of these activities willautomatically re-activate the committer for the purposes of voting.</p><h3>7 INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>7.1 The Pluto project site must provide the following:<p>a) Bug Database -- This is a system for tracking bugs and featurerequests.<p>b) Source Repository -- A CVS repositorycontaining both the source code and documentation for the Plutoproject. The project will have a set of committers to itsrepository.<p>c) Website -- A  jakarta.apache.org/pluto website will contain information aboutthe Pluto project, including documentation, downloads ofreleases, and this charter. <p>d) General Mailing List -- This mailing list is open to the public. It isintended for discussions for Pluto users. Suggested name pluto-user@jakarta.apache.org<p>e) Development Mailing List -- This mailing list is open to the public. A mailing list devoted to Pluto development.  Suggested name pluto-dev@jakarta.apache.org<p>f) Commits Mailing List -- A mailing list to log CVS commits. Suggested name pluto-commits@jakarta.apache.org<p><h3>8 LICENSING</h3>All contributions to the Pluto project adhere to the "ASF Source Code License." All further contributions must be made under thesame terms. All contributed files must contain the full text of the ASF Source Code License.<p><h3>9 THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h3><p>The development process is intentionally lightweight; like otherApache projects, the committers decide which changes may be committedto the repository. Three +1 ('yes' votes) with no -1 ('no' votes orvetoes) are needed to approve a code change. For efficiency, some codechanges from some contributors (e.g. feature additions, bug fixes) maybe approved in advance, in which case they may be committed first andchanged as needed, with conflicts resolved by majority vote of thecommitters.</p><h3>10 Relationship with other Apache projects</h3><p>10.1 The Pluto project should work closely with other Apache projects, suchas Jakarta (e.g. tomcat, JetSpeed), Web Services (e.g. WSRP4J), and XML(e.g. Cocoon), to avoid redundancy and achieve a coherent architectureamong Pluto and these projects.</p> </body></html>

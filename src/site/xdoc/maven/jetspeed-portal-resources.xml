      <p>
        The Jetspeed-2 Portal, <em>as a portal framework</em>, provides many optional features and configuration elements, some of which are used even during the build (and testing)
        of the Jetspeed-2 Portal project itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, because of the highly customizable configuration of a Jetspeed-2 Portal, not all of its available resources and configuration files are needed nor desired
        to be used and packaged for each and every target environment.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, the Jetspeed-2 Portal project provides pre-packaged resources as Maven Artifact, the <strong><code>jetspeed-portal-resources:jar</code></strong>,
        which can be used to only selectively use the needed resources for a specific target (artifact) or integration task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important and commonly used resources provided by the jetspeed-portal-resources artifact are for example:
        <ul>
          <li>Spring configurations (/assembly)</li>
          <li>Database schema definitions (/ddl-schema)</li>
          <li>Pre-generated database ddl scripts (/ddl)</li>
          <li>Portal and application server property and configurations files (/conf)</li>
          <li>Predefined minimal and example database initialization data (/seed)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the <a href="jetspeed-unpack-plugin.html">jetspeed-unpack:unpack</a> and <a href="jetspeed-db-init-plugin.html">jetspeed-db:init</a> plugin can unpack selected resources
        from resource archives for which commonly the jetspeed-portal-resources artifact is used.

            <p>
                Jetspeed 2 provides the four following high level security services:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>UserManager</code>
                        : Service providing user management capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>GroupManager</code>
                        : Service providing group management capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>RoleManager</code>
                        : Service providing role management capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>PermissionManager</code>
                        : Service providing permission management capabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <section name="Using High Level Security Services in Portlets">
            <p>
                In order to access Jetspeed high level security services in your portlets, Jetspeed provide a custom
                extension to the <code>portlet.xml</code> metadata.  All Jetspeed custom metadata is located in the 
                <code>jetspeed-portlet.xml</code> configuration file in the <code>WEB-INF</code> folder of the portlet
                application.  The custom <code>js:services</code> tag provides the ability to expose portal services
                to a portlet through the <code>javax.portlet.PortletContext</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jetspeed portal services are configured in the spring assembly file located in the portal 
                <code>WEB-INF/assembly/jetspeed-services</code> configuration file.  The UserManager for instance
                is configured as follow:
                <source><![CDATA[
<!-- Portlet Services  -->
<bean id="PortalServices" 
  	 class="org.apache.jetspeed.services.JetspeedPortletServices" >
   <constructor-arg>
      <map>
  	     ...
  	     <entry key="UserManager">
  	   	    <ref bean="org.apache.jetspeed.security.UserManager"/>
  	   	 </entry>
  	   	 ...
      </map>
   </constructor-arg>
</bean>]]>
                </source>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>UserManager</code> services is then available to be loaded in a specific portlet
                <code>PortletContext</code>.  Portlet developers need to specify the portal services they
                would like to use.  The following example shows how to expose the portal <code>UserManager</code> 
                to a portlet application:
                <source><![CDATA[
<js:services>
   <js:service name='UserManager'/>
</js:services>]]>
                </source>   
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a portal service is loaded in the portlet context, the portlet implementation (which typically
                extends <code>javax.portlet.GenericPortlet</code>) can access the service as follow:
                <source><![CDATA[
PortletContext context = getPortletContext();
userManager = (UserManager) context.getAttribute(CommonPortletServices.CPS_USER_MANAGER_COMPONENT);
]]>
                </source>
                where <code>CommonPortletServices.CPS_USER_MANAGER_COMPONENT = "cps:UserManager"</code>
            </p>
        </section>
    </body>
</document>

		<section name='2. What Database do you want'>
			<p>
				Jetspeed's security model requires a database to
				authorize users and to retain the user information.
				Jetspeed security should work with any JDBC 2.0
				compliant driver. The following databases are tested:
				<ul>
 				    <li>Derby</li>
					<li>HSQLDB - Hypersonic SQL</li>
					<li>MySQL</li>
					<li>Oracle</li>
					<li>Postgres</li>
					<li>DB2</li>
					<li>Sybase</li>
					<li>SQL Server</li>
				</ul>

				Jetspeed is distributed with the Derby database
				configured as the default.
			</p>
			<p>
				The database configuration will be setup during the
				installation process. If you are not going to use the
				default Derby database, you need to select another database
				during installation.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="3 Servlet Engines">
			<p>
				In theory, Jetspeed 2 portals can be run under any
				servlet container supporting the 2.4 specification or
				greater. Successful Jetspeed 2 portal applications have
				been deployed using:
				<ul>
					<li>Tomcat 5.5.26 or higher</li>
					<li>Jetty</li>
					<li>Websphere</li>
					<li>Geronimo</li>
					<li>JBoss</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<subsection name=" Tomcat Configuration">
				<p>
					Jetspeed 2 can use the Tomcat Manager application
					for managing portlet applications with the Portlet
					Application Lifecycle Manager Portlet (PALM). To be
					able to do so it needs a configured Tomcat user with
					the predefined 'manager' role in the
					${org.apache.jetspeed.server.home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
				</p>
				<p>
					A minimal example tomcat-users.xml can look like:
					<source>
						<![CDATA[
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
    <user username="j2deployer" password="xxxxx" roles="manager"/>
</tomcat-users>]]>
					</source>
					<i>
						The attribute values for username and password
						must correspond to the specified values for
						<code>
							${org.apache.jetspeed.services.autodeployment.user}
						</code>
						and
						<code>
							${org.apache.jetspeed.services.autodeployment.user}
						</code>
						as described above.
					</i>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Tomcat 5.5.9 on Windows">
				<p>
					To have redeployment and undeployment working
					properly when using Tomcat 5.5.9 on Windows you have
					to set the global Context attribute "antiJARLocking"
					to true.
				</p>
				<p>
					In
					${org.apache.jetspeed.server.home}\conf\context.xml
					use:
					<source>
						<![CDATA[
    <Context antiJARLocking="true">
    ...
    </Context>]]>
					</source>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection
				name="Jetty - A Quick Test Environment or a Production Servlet Container">
			<p>
				Jetty can be used for a production deployment but it is
				most commonly used to quickly test customizations
				without interfering with the production servlet
				container. It does not require any special
				configuration.
			</p>

			name='4. Installing Jetspeed from Source or Binary Distributions'>
			<p>
				Depending on what you want to do, you have the choice of
				installing Jetspeed from a binary release or from the
				sources. If you want to modify the core functionality of
				Jetspeed or contribute to the development of Jetspeed,
				you need to work with the sources. If you are only
				interested in building your own custom enterprise
				portal, you can start with a binary release of Jetspeed.
				Most people should start with the binary distribution.

		<section name="Overview of the Jetspeed Portlet Applications">
		<p>Jetspeed is just a standalone portal server. Administration of the server is provided in a standard way: using standardized Java portlet applications.
		Since these portlet applications require specific knowledge of the Jetspeed server in order to manage it, the applications are distributed from Jetspeed, and not from Apache Portals Applications (<a href='http://portals.apache.org/applications/'>APA</a>).
		These applications make use of the Jetspeed API to manage the portal. For example, the administrative portlets manage security, users, portlet applications and more.
